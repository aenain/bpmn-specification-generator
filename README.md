bpmn-specification-generator
============================

Two-step process of generating logical specification based on a bpmn model. First step is to find van der Aalst patterns in the model and then generate logical specification using temporal logic.

Console
-------

To play with bpmn module (for now) run 'bash console' from the root directory of the project. If you use fish shell as I do, run 'fish console' instead.
